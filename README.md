# NeuralLearning
A collection of neural network related learnings gathered from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com, Stanford CS229, and various other resources.
- Notes are organized by "book" for the website, and "cs229" for the Standford lectures.

### Network.py
Originally provided by thebook website, but modified and adapted to include topics covered in later chapters (found in network2.py). Focuses on training a network to classify the MNIST data set. 

### Todo:
- [X] Reorganize repo
- [X] Remove unused files
- [ ] Begin understanding [RNNs](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/)
- [ ] Brush up on your Linear Alegbra notes, apply with Numpy.
