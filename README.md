# NeuralLearning
A collection of neural network related learnings gathered from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com, Stanford CS229, and various other resources.
- Notes can be found inside 'thebook' for neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com
- Notes can be found inside 'StandfordCS229' for the recorded Standford lecture (on youtube)

### Network.py
Originally provided by thebook website, but modified and adapted to include topics covered in later chapters (found in network2.py). Focuses on training a network to classify the MNIST data set. 

### Todo:
- [ ] Reorganize repo
- [ ] Remove unused files
- [ ] Begin understanding [RNNs](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/)
- [ ] Brush up on your Linear Alegbra notes, apply with Numpy.
